# 🧭 Warzone Game – COMP 345 Team Project  
### Advanced Program Design with C++  

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a modular C++ implementation of the strategy game **Warzone**.  
It is developed across multiple assignments, each one expanding the functionality of the previous stage.

The system models the core mechanics of the game, maps, players, cards, orders, and game flow while demonstrating object-oriented programming principles such as **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **encapsulation**, **copy control**, and **design patterns**.

All components are implemented as independent, testable modules with dedicated drivers and integrated through a single main program.

## ⚙️ How to Run
